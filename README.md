This project allows you to display all repositories of a GitHub user by searching for his username.
Enter the username you are looking at the top and then hit the "Submit"-button or press _Enter_ to search.
The repositories will be listed below, together with information about their forks and watchers.
Click on any repository to open it on GitHub!
To clear the repositories, hit the "Clear"-button!
If there was an Error, the error will be displayed on screen. (Try entering nothing and then "Submit" to see one of those errors)

To accomplish this the GitHub-Api is used.
State inside the application is managed with Redux.
The application is compatible with Chome, Edge and Firefox.
